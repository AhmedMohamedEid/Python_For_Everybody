# Why should you learn to write programs?

# Writing programs (or programming) is a very creative 
# and rewarding activity.  You can write programs
#  for 
# many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving
# a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping
# someone else solve a problem.  This book assumes that 
# everyone needs to know how to program, and that once 
# you know how to program you will figure out what you want 
# to do with your newfound skills.
